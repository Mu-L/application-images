# Container images for graphical applications

This repository contains Dockerfiles that produce container images suitable for use with the [docker-shell](https://github.com/adamrehn/docker-shell) command-line tool. These images are designed to provide self-contained and repeatable installations of specific graphical applications, with a focus on productivity and multimedia tools. The images leverage the unique features of docker-shell to automatically configure the necessary Docker options, thus providing a convenient and concise interface.

Note that some of the images install components which are not free and open source software (FOSS), and users who choose to build and run these images are responsible for complying with the relevant software licenses.
